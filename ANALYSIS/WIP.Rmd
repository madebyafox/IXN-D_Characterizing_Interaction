NOTE! THE CONTENT OF THIS NOTEBOOK [UP UNTIL WIP] is included in CHI-submission supplementals.  Further analysis should pick up and extend WIP section. 

This notebook includes *exploratory data analysis* (primarily through visualization) for data collected for the IXN-D project. These analyses were conducted by [TODO-X-ANONYMIZED] who can be reached at [TODO-X-ANONYMIZED].

Data are imported for analysis from two sources:

1.  **coded utterances ---** CSV file `CLEAN_coded_utterances.csv` constitutes output of content analysis coding process, which transforms linguistic output of (experimental) task transcripts into discretized units of meaning, each associated with (no more than 2) detail-code and a corresponding topic-code, indicating the topic & (detail) subject to which the utterance referred. Importantly, this sheet *also* contains a (manual) identification of *what representations* the participant was using *while making an utterance*. These data were entered by the analyst during the content analysis process.

2.  **telemetry representations** --- CSV file `arf_CLEAN_telemetry_representations.csv` constitutes output of telemetry wrangling scripts, which transform raw log-telemetry data from the (experimental) analysis tasks into a flat file indicating what representations (including code and data visualizations) were generated by participants at what times

Through the data import process we cast a number of dataframe variables as FACTORS to be used during analysis, and the construct the following dataframes:

1.  **Raw data** [for reference, troubleshooting]
    1.  `df_raw_utterances` raw utterance data from `coded_utterances.csv`

    2.  `df_raw_telemetry` raw (telemetry) representation data from `telemetry_representations.csv`
2.  **Wrangled data** [for analysis]
    1.  `df_coded` utterance data (from `df_raw_utterances`) . Each row corresponds to one unique [utterance+detail code] pair. In most cases, utterances are unique. In a limited number of cases where utterances are *dual-coded* (the utterance contained more than one unit of meaning but could not be further discretized into smaller utterances while maintaining readability),the utterance then appears on two rows, once for each associated detail-code.

    2.  `df_codedrep` utterance + (manual) representation data (from `df_raw_utterances`). This dataframe takes the `df_coded` df and pivots it to a long format where each row/observation refers to one unique [utterance+representation] combination. Many utterances were generated via reference to more than one representation (again, these representations were manually added by the data analyst doing content analysis coding, who made note of what representations the participant scrolled to, interacted with, and/or made reference to with mouse gestures).

    3.  `df_telemetry` log-telemetry data (from `df_raw_telemetry`). Each row indicates a unique representation (code output, table, or visualization) generated during the (experimental) analysis tasks, and captured by the logging utility attached to the Jupyter notebook. Each row represents a unique representation, or *version* of the representation (i.e. if an interaction technique, or additional encoding is added to an existing representation in a code cell, this is tracked as a new representation.)

```

The following variables, some common across dataframes, are especially important to the subsequent analyses:

1.  `PID` is a (unique) random identifier for participant
2.  `PNUM` is the corresponding 'participant number' (e.g. P1, P2, etc) for each `PID` as used in the paper
3.  `TASK` refers to the experimental task (within-subjects; repeated measures) either `static` or `ixn` (interactive)
4.  `DATASET` refers to the dataset attached to the corresponding `TASK`, either `happiness` (had a numeric-continuous outcome variable) or `space` (had a nomial-categorical outcome variable)
5.  `data_order` indicates the dataset counterbalancing order for the corresponding participant, either `space-first` or `happiness-first`. Most graphs are *sorted* by `data_order`
6.  `code_topic` is the outcome variable indicating the highest level code applied during content analysis
7.  `code_detail` is the outcome variable indicating the lowest-level (detail) code applied during content analysis
8.  `ixn` is a boolean flag (for utterance dfs only) indicating whether the participant was *actively engaging with an interactive visualization* while making the utterance. (i.e. inspecting/reading an interactive graph without using the interaction feature is coded as `FALSE`)
9.  `relative_time` indicates the time (in seconds) after the start of the task at which the utterance occurs
10. `rep_simple` is an outcome variable indicating what kind of representation what was used while the utterance was made (detail of visualization type + one category for code output + one category for code output that yields a table, such as df.describe(), df.info(), etc.)
11. `rep_type` is an outcome variable indicating the high-level category for what kind of representation was used while the utterance was made: `CHART`, `CODE` (including tables) or `NONE`
12. `REP` is used in the `df_telemetry` df to refer to the detail kind of representation
13. `rep_type` is used in the `df_telemetry` df to refer to high level kind of representation, but does not include code cells *other* than those that generate tables. (Also does not contain NONE as a valid value because NONE refers to utterances made without reference to a representation, and the telemetry data contains only representations, not utterances)

# PROFILE DATA

## PROFILE UTTERANCE-CODE

There are `r nrow(df_coded)` rows in the `df_coded` dataset, where each row represents an utterance+coding (i.e. utterance + detail code). There are `r nlevels(df_coded$uid)` *unique* utterances. The difference indicates utterances that were *dual-coded* (i.e. two detail-level codes). No more than two codes were applied to a single utterance. For the purposes of analysis, dual-coded utterances will be treated as two utterances, as they have two distinct (but lexically insepeperable) units of meaning.

*The following profile reflects a dataframe where individual observations refer to unique utterance+detail_code*.

```{r utterance-profile, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df_coded%>% summarytools::dfSummary(
             plain.ascii  = FALSE,
             graph.magnif = 0.75,
             style        = "grid",
             tmp.img.dir  = "temp",
             missing.col = FALSE, 
             method = "render"
)

```

*[TODO-X-ANONYMIZED] has reviewed data profile for missing data and correct factorization.*

## PROFILE UTTERANCE-REPRESENTATION

There are `r nrow(df_codedrep)` rows in the `df_codedrep` dataset, where each row represents an utterance+representation (i.e. utterance + detail-level rep). There are `r nlevels(df_codedrep$uid)` *unique* utterances (*should match `df_coded` dataframe*). The difference indicates utterances that used *multiple representations* (i.e. two graphs, or a graph and a table).

*The following profile reflects a dataframe where individual observations refer to unique utterance+representation*.

```{r utterance-rep-profile, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df_codedrep%>% summarytools::dfSummary(
             plain.ascii  = FALSE,
             graph.magnif = 0.75,
             style        = "grid",
             tmp.img.dir  = "temp",
             missing.col = FALSE, 
             method = "render"
)

```

*[TODO-X-ANONYMIZED] has reviewed data profile for missing data and correct factorization.*

## PROFILE REPRESENTATIONS

There are `r nrow(df_telemetry)` rows in the `df_telemetry` dataset, where each row represents a unique representation generated by a participant during an analysis task, as captured by the logging utility.

There are `r nrow(df_telemetry)` *unique* representation-versions. The difference between this and the number of representations referenced in the`df_codedrep` is a result of the orientation and source of the data: `df_telemetry` may contain representations that are not used in the course of making an utterance, and `df_codedrep` may include representations that are referenced multiple times in the course of multiple utterances. There is no variable on which representations from `df_telemetry` and `df_codedrep` can joined.

*The following profile reflects a dataframe where individual observations refer to unique representation_versions.*

```{r REP-profile, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df_telemetry%>% summarytools::dfSummary(
             plain.ascii  = FALSE,
             graph.magnif = 0.75,

# EXPLORE UTTERANCES

**Utterances** are the lowest-level discrete units of meaning transcribed from the EDA Task transcripts. Utterances are coded at two levels of analysis: (1) **topic-code** gives a *high level* topic of the participant's verbalization, (2) **detail-code** gives the *lower level* detail of the subject.

In the following subsections we explore the distribution of *number of utterances* based on TASK, DATASET, and PARTICIPANT, before describing the distribution of utterances *through the timecourse* of the TASK.

## [Number of] Utterances

FIRST we explore the distribution of utterances by Analysis Task, Dataset, Participant and Time, irrespective of what the utterance was about (topic, detail).

***RQ: How much did participants talk aloud during EDA? When did they talk aloud?***

***Answer:** Inspection of frequency tables and visualizations suggests that the most substantial determinant of how many utterances an individual made is individual participant-level differences, rather than structural differences imposed by the TASK or DATASET. This is not altogether unexpected given the fact that across both tasks (static/interactive) and datasets the structure of the experimental task was the same*

### by TASK

freq(df_coded$TASK, 
     cumul      = FALSE,

```

### by TASK and DATASET

#DF SUMMARIZED BY TASK + DATASET

    title = "Participant Utterances over timecourse of Task",
    x= "timecourse of task (seconds)", y = "frequency of utterances",
  ) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "blank")


```

## [TOPIC of] Utterances

NEXT we explore the distribution of utterances coded by high level TOPIC, across Analysis Task, Dataset, Participant and Time.

***RQ: What kinds of things did participants talk aloud during EDA? Did they progress through any 'topical phases' over the course of the task? Or are topics equally distributed across analysis time?***

***Answer:** Inspection of frequency tables and visualizations suggests that:*

1.  *Individual differences continue to play an important role*

2.  *There do not appear to be strong TASK/DATASET effects on topic that are consistent across participants.*

3.  *PROCESS and RELATIONSHIP topics are more evenly distributed across the timecourse of analysis, while DATASET AND VARIABLE topics are more tightly clustered near the beginning of the analysis. This pattern of distribution is sensical given what we know about EDA, and is consistent with the intuition that patterns of thought during EDA are likely more iterative and situational than we think (or model).*

### TOPICS

# + theme(legend.position = "blank")

ggsave(p, file="figures/UTTERANCE_topics_by_factors.png")


```

*NOTE: Here we see an interesting pattern in the IXN-HAPPINESS dataset, where there are far fewer utterances about VARIABLES and more utterances about RELATIONSHIPS. Analysts believe this is likely* a result of using INTERACTIVE-PROFILE visualization, where participants seemed to skip over characterization of the univariate distributions in favor of observing or speculating about the potential relationships *between* variables while actively scrubbing across one of the profiler histograms.

### by PARTICIPANT

#     subtitle = "",
#     x = "number of coded utterances",
#     y = "participant",
#     fill = "DATASET"
#   )
```

*NOTE: There appear to be substantial individual differences in the number* of utterances participants generate, and to some extent to the high level *topic* of the utterances. It is possible, however, this is also related to individuals' relative familiarity/interest in exploring data with numeric vs. nominal outcome variables. Both data analysts noted participants (in general) seemed to struggle more in choosing and interpreting representations aimed at representing relationships with nominal variables.

## [DETAIL of] Utterances

NEXT we explore the distribution of specific detail utterances across Analysis Task, Dataset, Participant and Time.

We organize these sections according to the high-level topic codes: (ANALYSIS) PROCESS, DATASET, VARIABLE, RELATIONSHIP

***RQ: What specific things did participants talk aloud during EDA? Are there any details folks only*** **mention during static(v)interactive, or nominal(v)numeric tasks? Any substantial changes in proportion by TASK or DATASET?**

# EXPLORE TELEMETRY REPRESENTATIONS

**Representations** are computationally-generated visual-spatial artifacts that participants use during the EDA tasks. These include data visualizations, but also tabular code outputs, or other data structures returned by Python code.

NOTE that there are three uses of representations we explore in this project:

1.  Representations *used or referenced* during the course of making an utterance. These representations are explored in the [DETAIL of] Utterances sections (above).
2.  Representations *used interactively* during the course of making an utterance. These include charts to which an interaction encoding is added via Altair Express, but *only* when they are *actively engaged* in while making an utterance. These are also explored in the [DETAIL of] Utterances sections (above).
3.  Representations created by participants during the analysis task. These are not necessarily associated with utterances. These are the representations we explore in this section, and they are derived from log-telemetry data.

In the following subsections we start by exploring the distribution of *kinds of representations* participants generated based on TASK, DATASET, and PARTICIPANT. [TELEMETRY] Representations

***RQ: How many representations did participants generate? Of what kinds? At what times during the process of analysis?*** (These are the representations coming from telemetry. Not connected to utterances explicitly. Code only reps are excluded, but tabular output of code cells (eg. .info(), .describe(), etc. included)
